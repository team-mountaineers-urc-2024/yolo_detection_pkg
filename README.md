# Yolo Detection Package

## Description
This Package analyzes camera data using YOLO detection models. It outputs a pose array of objects that it sees, and estimates distance and orientation information.

## Known Limitations
This package was not implemented on the rover due to time constraints. The distance and position estimation are somewhat reliable in certain circumstances but may encounter trouble depending on object orientation.
